     * own static cache, meaning it deliberately rebuilds the full module list from scratch on
     * every single call while running tests. Every module boot calls module_path() at least
     * once (via loadMigrationsFrom), which calls find() -> all() -> scan() - so with that guard
     * in play, N modules means N full rebuilds of N Module objects each: O(n^2) per boot, not
     * O(n). At 52 modules this alone was ~30-40ms/module of pure waste; it scales quadratically
     * so it would become catastrophic well before reaching the catalog's 675-module target.
     * This class's RepositoryInterface binding is a per-Application singleton, and the whole
     * Application is rebuilt fresh for every test anyway, so there is no staleness risk in
     * memoizing per-instance regardless of the test-running guard.
